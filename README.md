# Churn Data Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to the Churn Data Analysis project! This comprehensive project showcases the end-to-end data science project for analyzing churn data. We will walk through the essential steps of data cleaning, data transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models to understand and predict customer churn.

## Data Cleaning:
Data cleaning is the foundation of any data analysis project. In this stage, we address missing values, handle outliers, and perform necessary data transformations to ensure the data is in a clean and usable format for analysis.

## Data Transformation:
Data transformation is essential for preparing the churn data for modeling. We will perform feature engineering, encode categorical variables, and scale numeric features to create a feature set suitable for building predictive models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
EDA plays a crucial role in understanding the patterns and relationships within the churn data. Through data visualization and statistical analysis, we will gain insights into factors that contribute to customer churn and identify potential trends and correlations.

## Modeling:
The final and exciting stage of the pipeline involves building predictive models for customer churn. We will apply various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, to predict churn and evaluate model performance.
